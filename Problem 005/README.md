## Notes

It looks like what the problem is actully talking, in its example, in not so straightforward way, is about LCM of all the numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive.

I remember having learnt that LCM of 3 numbers can be calculated as: `LCM(LCM(a, b), c)` and this can be nested upto any number of numbers.

I think I have solved the problem in my head. But first let me add to [My Tools](./My+Tools/) an LCM of 2, 3 and n numbers program. I will do this in python because I feel like I'm pretty comfortable in C++ and Java but my python needs a bit practing for now.
