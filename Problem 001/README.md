# Multiples of 3 & 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Notes

Previously when I solved this problem, I intentinally used for loops and not the real mathematics of arithmetic progressions. Even though I knew it was better solved by maths I didn't do it. It was largely due to how we are trained in our schools and colleges where the teacher would argue that the problem a programming problem where I need to show my skills with for loops and not with mathematics. But this is not school so I have updated my solution to my liking.
